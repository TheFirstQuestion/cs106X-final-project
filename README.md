# CS 106X Final Project
### Proposal
For my final project, I'm planning to create some sort of file manager. I would basically create an abstraction over the hierarchical file system so that the user can browse files the way they browse the web: by searching and pulling together bits and pieces from files in different locations.

The use cases would look something like this: I search for a quote that I don't remember the source of but know I have saved somewhere -- the results point to an essay I wrote in middle school, as well as subtitles from the movie the essay is about. I need to quickly create a GitHub README but don't have a template saved -- I can search and see all the READMEs I have saved, across multiple folders/projects.

There would also be some sort of non-linear browsing mode -- so you can see all english papers you've written, or test report PDFs, no matter what folders they might be in. In this case, the user could browse by tag/topic/keyword rather than folder; the many-to-many scheme is much more flexible and similar to how people think.

The underlying structure will probably include a map for tags, and linked data structures of some type for the searching part. I will look into what algorithms Google and other search engines use to be able to quickly search through millions of pages of text.

Iâ€™m leaning towards writing it in Python, using HTML/CSS for a simple GUI, but C++ or a shell script might be better for the low-level file system part. Depending on how long the scanning/processing of the file system takes, I will probably cache the results in a database.

### Jerry's Response
Wow, Sophie.  I love this so much!.
I am slightly concerned that it's more than I would really expect from a CS106X student, but if you're willing to complete a significant chunk of it -- maybe the server-side portion of the web app and leaving the web work to be completed for a personal project -- then that would be fine with me as well.  But I love the creativity and the ambition, so I want you to do as much of it as you have time for.

### Further Notes
This is a proof-of-concept, not a production system. There are a lot of file types that are simply ignored. Both the OCR and NLP implementations are very rudimentary and really not at all good at their job. I do think it provides a good model as to what the future of file managers may look like.
Also: notice that you can't open files natively! This is because your browser doesn't permit access to your operating system (which is a very, very good thing).

## Dependencies
* `apt-get install tesseract-ocr pandoc`
* `python3 -m pip install pytesseract opencv-python pypandoc sqlalchemy tika nltk marshmallow marshmallow-sqlalchemy flask`

## Configuration
#### Required
* `initializeDatabase.py`:
** `ROOT_OF_FILE_SYSTEM`: the root of the file system; all folders within it will be searched; this path should be relative to the location of `main.py`

#### Optional
* `config/extension-blacklist.txt`: a list of extensions for files to ignore, i.e. caches; one per line
* `config/folder-blacklist.txt`: a list of folders to ignore, i.e. libraries, bin; one per line
* `config/definitions.json`: categorizes extensions into types of files, which determines how they are read
* `initializeDatabase.py`:
** `DB_NAME`: the name of the database file (including extension)

## Running
* `python3 setup.py` (once) -- downloads nltk data
* `python3 initializeDatabase.py` -- rescans all the files to generate the database; may take a while!
* `python3 main.py`

Click on a file or keyword to focus on it. Type into the box to search for keywords (case sensitive). Hold shift while clicking on a file to "open" the file (in a new window).

---

## TODO
* create makefile?
* multiple keyword filters
    * once chosen, go to top of screen, click again to un-choose
* add weight calculations into ordering display, choosing which (in init too)
* ability to search whole contents
* make drawing a shape one function, independent of keyword/folder/file
* UI tweaks:
    * animations!
    * add lines? (dashed, slightly darker blue)
    * shadow text box?
    * adjust number of items shown at different times
* Fixes (not  mission critical):
    * `'NoneType object is not iterable'`
    * `libpng warning: iCCP: known incorrect sRGB profile`
    * `Premature end of JPEG file`
    * `Pandoc died with exitcode "1" during conversion: b"pandoc: couldn't parse docx file\nCallStack (from HasCallStack):\n  error, called at src/Text/Pandoc/Error.hs:55:28 in pandoc-1.19.2.4-HbfKWUyODESBIy0vGktOwX:Text.Pandoc.Error\n"`
* add more keyword options
    * folder names -- also add individual words (split on space, dash, underscore, camelCase?)
    * also, folder/file names can conflict with keywords (case sensitive?)
    * some sort of proper noun lookup?
* generalize keywords semantically
    * ie, calculus --> math
    * music --> music type files
    * programming words --> programming files

## (Tentative) Relevance Weights
```
when user searches for word / words...

is keyword: 3 (programming: * 0.25)
shares stem w/ keyword: 2 (programming: * 0.25)
matches phrase: 3 * length of phrase (programming: * 0.5)

is whole file name: 2 * length of file name
is part of file name: 6

is whole folder name: 5
is part of folder name: 4

is whole folder name of a parent: 5 / levels between
is part of folder name: 4 / levels between
```

## UI Design
Folder = rectangle
File = triangle
Keyword = circle

keyword = white
folder = yellow

documents = green
image = blue
programming = purple
misc. = red

audio, archive, video = pink
